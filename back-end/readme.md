v. How to run in local
To run your Express.js application with the MongoDB database locally, follow these steps:

1. Install MongoDB: Download and install MongoDB on your local machine. You can find the installation instructions for your specific operating system on the MongoDB website: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

2. Clone your project: If you haven't already, clone your project repository to your local machine.

3. Install dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root folder of your project, and run the following command to install the required dependencies specified in your `package.json`:

```
npm install
```

4. Start MongoDB: Start the MongoDB server on your local machine. Depending on your installation method, this may involve running a command like `mongod` or starting the MongoDB service.

5. Connect to MongoDB: In your Express.js application, ensure that you have set up the connection to the local MongoDB database. Typically, this is done in the `app.js` or `index.js` file. Use the `mongoose.connect()` method to establish the connection. For example:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name';

mongoose.connect(mongoURI, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  useFindAndModify: false,
})
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', err);
  });
```

Replace `'your_database_name'` with the name of your MongoDB database.

6. Start the server: Start your Express.js server using the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will run the script defined in your `package.json` to start your server..

7. Access your application: Once the server is running, you can access your application in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:port`, where `port` is the port number specified in your Express.js configuration (e.g., 3000, 8080, etc.). The default to port is 3000 for this project.

8. Test the APIs: Use tools like cURL, Postman, or your favorite web browser to test the different endpoints and functionalities of your REST API.
